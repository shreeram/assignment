### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].
* In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have the
  [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] installed on your machine. Check out the section on
  [end-to-end testing](#e2e-testing) for more info.

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].


## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  view1/                --> the view1 view template and logic
    view1.html            --> the partial template
    view1.js              --> the controller logic
    view1_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  index-async.html      --> just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
```


## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the `angular-seed` application: Unit tests and end-to-end tests.

### Running Unit Tests

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will start
watching the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them
changes.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit. This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected. The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
npm run test-single-run
```
